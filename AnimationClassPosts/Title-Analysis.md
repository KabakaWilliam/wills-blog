# Arcane Opening

The first thing that strikes when you look at Netflix's Arcane opening is the stone / marble textures applied to the characters. What intiially looks like static marble statues are revealed to be slowed down characters relative to the camera. This has the effect of giving the viewers more time to analyze the traits of the different characters on the screen whilst also fitting within the context of the show being about "Legends" or idols within the video game: League of Legends.

Next, we have to acknowlegde the remarkable use of lighting to add context to the different characters. Rather than have plain marble statues, the animators opted to play with colors that are motifs of the different characters within the show. Apart from making the scene more visually interesting, the audience is primed to associate each character with a particular color cue. Effectively, this is a masterclass in the art of "show not tell".

It would also be remiss to not mention how the cinematography and blocking contributed to holding the audiences visual attention. By centering the different characters within the scene and keeping off center elements minimal, the animators are able to easily communicate an idea or motif simply.

### The hero vs the villain

### The wise man

### The invention that changed everythin

These scenes all have their main idea firmly in the center of the screen. In an opening that is less than 80 seconds, the animators make the most of every frame by centering the action and also slowing down the animation to allwo for these ideas to be baked into the audience's subconscious

And last, but arguably the highlight of the title sequence, we need to acknowlegde the brilliance of the score by Imagine Dragons. The song is filled with epic and dramatic swings which lends itself to the grand scope of the story being told. It makes the centered-slow-motion shots even more dramatic and adds gravity to each cut made between each shot (since the sequence was edited to the beat). By the time the final note is hit, your average viewer is no longer a passive listener, but is absorbed into the cinematic world of the story before any lines of dialogue are said. Saying it is an epic sequence would be an understatement.

In the end, I give it 10/10 stars for execution.
