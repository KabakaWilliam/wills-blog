# REQUIEM OPENING SCENE

#### Live Project

[![FINAL LOOK](https://github.com/KabakaWilliam/wills-blog/blob/main/BlogPics/project3/coverImage.png?raw=true)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgsHpLbW-qU)

## Breakdown

To achieve the ending camera move(tilt & pan before centering face), I set keyframes to the camera and moved it in the path I wanted it to move to through the help of the orbit camera button. This allowed for me to create a natural path for the camera to follow.

I was not a fan of the models but was unable to really make significant edits to them or edit their lips due to time. To counteract this, I used a model that was masked and tried to make it work.

The hardest part of the scene was getting the shots inside the car to render. I solved this by turning off different components of the car and shooting on a really tight camera lens(focal length 100) so as to squeeze space in the car together.
