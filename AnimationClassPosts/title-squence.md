# Final Look

## Workflow breakdown

### Marble Motif

I made use of a heavy marble motif throughout the the title sequence so attached different marble textures to the floor and statues. This was also my first time using the floor environment object

### Opening shot

I made use of a spotlight which I placed above the Mary statue. This spotlight created a chiarascuro shadow above the statue whilst providing sharp edge lighting. This made the image very dramatic.

I framed the shot from a low angle and slowly zoomed to the face of the statue. THis involved increasing the number of frames per second and keyframing the camera zoom to last long. In editing, I then applied a cross dissovle and cut accross the zoom in order to make the scene more dramatic.

### Marching scene

The marching scene had me apply the same walking animartion to the medical character models. I made sure to place them at different starting positions relative to the camera in order to pass off the illusion of them walking at different speeds. I also made it slow motion by increasing the number of frames per second on the timeline.

I made sure to animate a slow push-in from the camera to give the scene added depth. The marble material I chose did not reflect light properly, but rather it created a unique noise pattern that looked like water. So I added an overhead spotlight reflecting off the marble floor to pass off the illusion that the characters were walkign over dark water.

### Bust reveal

I planned for the final shot to be a slow reveal of the three main character's busts. By animating two lights: an overhead spotlight and a sidelight as seen below.

By animating the y angle of the light, I was able to envelop the middle bust in shadow whilst animating the side light to pan from left to right. This had the effect of hiding the middle bust whilst slowly revealing different characters in the scene before finally revealing the main bust in the center and leaving it centered in the screen.
