# Final Look

<br/>

## Workflow breakdown

My starting reference for this scene was this shot from Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix and Death Stranding:

<br/>

I particularly liked the layout of the hills and the river tucked between them.

To implement the hills, I made use of the landscape object and cloned it 4 times. I then moved the hills into a square position such that the landscape was composed of four separate hills. This is what the output looked like :

I then added a plane behind the hills with the following image to make it look like a sunset backdrop to a world with multiple moons. To really sell the sunset lighting, I attached a spotlight infront of the pictures location of the sun.

To add grass to the hills, I made use of the grow grass preset and attached it onto the landscape objects. An interesting caveat of this method was that it required me to render the entire image in order to see the grass.

<br/>

To create the river, I created a plane and attached a water material to it. To give off a swamp like vibe, I ensured that the water was refletive in the background, but transparent in the foreground to allow us to see the water in the river. I then lowered the plane to the sea level slowly adjusted its height until the water was between the hills.

It did look very plain at this point, so I decided to add more vegetation. But not any vegetation would work for this scrappy, desolate, tech wasteland. I decided to create metalic vegetation similar to that seen in the Horizon Zero Dawn game series.

<br/>

###### reference from Horizon Zero Dawn

<br/>

To actually design the metalic flowers, I used a satellite model provided by the asset browser. From this model, I selected the satelite arm and created a scatter object. I then drew across the landscape to generate the flowers.

In the beginning of the lake I added the satelite dish to imply the fact that this landscape is a wasteland.

No world is complete without organisms. Sinze I wanted to copy the atmosphere from horizon zero dawn I took inspiration from the watcher machines.

<br/>

I went to the asset browser and used the spaceship model as it had a similar color pallet and machine feel. By having the edge of the spaceship appear in the foreground, I made it appear as if the spaceship was actually a walking robot. I cloned a few of the spaceships to give the picture more life.

And viola, this is the final look after completing the render.
