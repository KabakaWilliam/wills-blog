# Final Look

## Workflow breakdown

My starting reference for this scene was this shot from Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix:

I particularly liked the layout of the hills and the river tucked between them.

To implement the hills, I made use of the landscape object and cloned it 4 times. I then moved the hills into a square position such that the landscape was composed of four separate hills. This is what the output looked like :

I then added a plane behind the hills with the following image to make it look like a sunset background to a world with multiple moons.

To add grass to the hills, I made use of the grow grass preset and attached it onto the landscape objects. An interesting caveat of this method was that it required me to render the entire image in order to see the grass.
