David Han is a renowned artist, Emmy award winner, and recent Annie Award winner for his work on Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse. He attended the School of Visual Arts in 2004 and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Computer Animation. He speaks of realizing his passion for animation, after taking a whole night in his junior year to complete an assignment without any sleep. All he could think of was getting to his class the next morning just so he could show others his work. This moment stuck with him and led him to his path as an industry animator.

Starting out was difficult. The jobs were few and the pay was low, so he had to survive by working from gig to gig. But even during this time as a “struggling artist”, he still found time to expand on his passions for animation by working on various side projects. His approach to working on these passion projects was to take his time. One of the more popular projects that he posted onto his Instagram was only 30 seconds long but took him nearly 2 years to complete. A meticulous artist, he wanted to infuse his art with as many references and well-choreographed sequences as possible. This attention to detail allowed for him to become known for his approach to action choreography.

In this particular fight above, he was inspired by anime. Specifically: dragon balls. Speaking on his inspiration behind getting into animation, he highlighted the extent to which that shonen anime like Rurouni Kenshin, Cowboy Beebop, Ghost in the Shell, and Dragon Ball had on his approach to animation. One need only look at his Instagram to see his obsession with anime. He literally has Goku from the original dragon ball manga as his profile picture.

Within his works, he often incorporates ink lines and smears commonly seen in shonen anime to exaggerate action. Much of his love for animation stems from wanting to recreate action set pieces that pay homage to the action in the anime that he grew up with and loves. In a sense, he could be thought of as a master of refining 2d animation techniques in 3d environments. Most of his approach to camera angles in the scenes he animates comes from his anime references and talent for drawing which allows him to plan out choreography for multiple scenes. He places a lot

of emphasis on characters and tries to anticipate their actions in scenes before animating. In one case, during the production of “Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse”, he took off two days to plan out how Miles Morales(the main character) would react to getting stuck outside of a window before being pulled by doves. Before touching Maya, he drew out all the action and recorded himself flailing his arms in order to simulate the action.

complicated scene that required Han to simulate and anticipate action

Because of this, he found success working on multiple feature animated films that incorporate this mix of 2d - 3d animation such as the Emoji movie, the angry birds movie, and his magnum opus “Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse”. As of now, he is currently a supervising animator on the new sequel to Miles Morale’s story- Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse as a supervising animator.
